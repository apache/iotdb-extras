# mybatis-generator-plugin

* After 'clone' the project, execute 'mvn clean install' or 'mvn clean deploy' locally ('deploy' needs to modify 'distributionManagement' in 'pom'). This step is not necessary as it has already been uploaded to the Maven central repository

* Add the following configuration to the 'pom' file of the project to be generated:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.mybatis.generator</groupId>
            <artifactId>mybatis-generator-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>1.4.2</version>
            <dependencies>
                <dependency>
                    <groupId>org.apache.iotdb</groupId>
                    <artifactId>mybatis-generator-plugin</artifactId>
                    <version>2.0.2-SNAPSHOT</version>
                </dependency>
            </dependencies>
            <configuration>
                <verbose>true</verbose>
                <overwrite>true</overwrite>
                <configurationFile>src/main/resources/generatorConfig.xml</configurationFile>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```
